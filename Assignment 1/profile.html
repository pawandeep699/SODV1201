                    developer is who can make any idea into reality by his programmimg skills. I am also working on my typing skills to type<br>
                    code fast. I am very keen to learn new techniques and methods to be a good programmer and developer. I have tried to<br>
                    remove all distractions like Netflix, Instagram and Video Games. I am learning from websites like code camp and codecademy<br>
                    to upgrade my programmimg skills.<br><br><br><br>
